<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an 18-year-old first-year student at VIT Vellore,
  originally from Mumbai, with a passion for coding and technology.
  I'm currently honing my skills in Python and C while diving into the world of web development.
  Learning new languages and building projects is something I truly enjoy, as it gives me the chance to turn ideas into
  reality.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games or watching football.
  I've always been fascinated by the strategic thinking and teamwork in both gaming and sports.
  This love for problem-solving has naturally translated into my approach to programming,
  where I aim to create clean, efficient, and practical solutions.</p>

<p>As I continue my journey into web development,
  I'm excited to expand my skill set and collaborate on projects that combine creativity with technical expertise.
  My portfolio showcases my growth as a developer,
  and I'm eager to take on new challenges in the field.</p>
